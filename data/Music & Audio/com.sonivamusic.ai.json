The female vocalist sang it so beautifully. The pauses and areas that needed to be loud or soft were perfect. You get two songs each time you create. The app gives you three creations free. Afterwards, it costs $5.99 a week for 20 songs. Not bad. Only one thing wrong, there needs to be an edit for lyrics after the song is created.",

The songs come out amazing with great lyrics and the vocals sound flawless. I genuinely love every song it's made so far. It's a shame that each input uses two credits, but I do like having two versions of the same song to choose from. I tried several AI song making apps before finding this one, and it's the best by far.",

Well done creators but please let it be free with no subscriptions. Also, the fact that it's the right tune, it's really adoring.

    "AIReview": "<h2>AI Song Maker: Soniva Music - A Comprehensive Review</h2>\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>AI Song Maker: Soniva Music is an ambitious entry into the burgeoning field of AI-powered music generation. With over 316,000 installs and a solid 4.7-star rating from 16,290 users, it’s clear that this app has captured the attention of many who are interested in exploring simplified music creation tools.  The core premise – generating professional-sounding songs based on user descriptions – is undeniably appealing, particularly to those lacking formal musical training or extensive equipment. Soniva positions itself as a solution for both beginners and experienced musicians looking for rapid prototyping and inspiration. The app’s free price point further contributes to its accessibility, making it a low-risk option to explore the possibilities of AI in music production.</p>\n<h2>Key Features</h2>\n<p>The app&#39;s functionality centers around several key features designed to streamline the song creation process:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>AI Song Generator:</strong> This is the heart of Soniva. Users input a description of their desired musical style, mood, and even lyrical themes. The AI then generates an entire song – including instrumental tracks, vocals (synthesized), and lyrics – based on this prompt.</li>\n<li><strong>Genre Selection:</strong> While the AI can generate across many genres, users are presented with a list of options to guide the initial generation process. These include Pop, Hip-Hop, Electronic, Rock, R&amp;B, Country, and more.</li>\n<li><strong>Lyric Customization:</strong> Users aren’t simply stuck with AI-generated lyrics. The app allows for editing and refinement of the generated text, offering a degree of control over the lyrical content.</li>\n<li><strong>Instrument Control (Limited):</strong>  Within the generated song, users have some level of control over individual instrument volumes, though this is primarily a volume adjustment rather than a full mixing or mastering experience.</li>\n<li><strong>Community Features:</strong> Soniva integrates a community aspect, aiming to foster connections among users and potentially inspire new ideas through shared creations. (Details on the community functionality are somewhat sparse within the app itself).</li>\n<li><strong>Export Options</strong>: The generated song can be exported in MP3 format for easy sharing or use elsewhere.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Strengths</h2>\n<p>Several aspects of Soniva contribute to its popularity:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ease of Use:</strong> The core concept – describing your desired music and receiving a full song – is remarkably intuitive. The app’s interface is clean and uncluttered, minimizing the learning curve.</li>\n<li><strong>Speed of Generation:</strong>  Generating a complete song takes only seconds, drastically reducing the time commitment required compared to traditional music production methods. This rapid prototyping capability is a significant advantage.</li>\n<li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Being free makes Soniva incredibly accessible to anyone curious about AI music generation. Removing financial barriers encourages experimentation and exploration.</li>\n<li><strong>Creative Spark</strong>: The app can genuinely serve as a useful tool for overcoming writer&#39;s block or generating initial song ideas, offering a starting point that users can then develop further.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Areas for Improvement</h2>\n<p>Despite its strengths, Soniva has several areas ripe for improvement:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Song Quality Variability:</strong>  The quality of the generated songs varies significantly. While some outputs are surprisingly good and polished, others are noticeably robotic or lack coherence, particularly in terms of musical structure and transitions.</li>\n<li><strong>Limited Instrumental Control</strong>: The current level of instrument control is extremely basic. More granular mixing options (EQ, compression, reverb) would greatly enhance the user’s ability to refine their creations.</li>\n<li><strong>Lyrical Consistency:</strong>  While lyrical customization exists, the AI&#39;s initial lyric generation often suffers from repetition or a lack of thematic consistency.</li>\n<li><strong>Community Features – Unfulfilled Potential</strong>: The community aspect feels underdeveloped. There&#39;s no obvious way to share creations directly within the app, limiting its potential for collaboration and inspiration.</li>\n<li><strong>Lack of Export Formats:</strong> MP3 export is currently the only option.  Offering WAV or other formats would broaden usability.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>User Experience</h2>\n<p>The user experience is generally positive, particularly considering the app’s free status and core functionality. The interface is well-organized, making it easy to navigate between the song generation feature, lyric editing, and instrument controls. However, the lack of tutorials or guidance on crafting effective prompts can be frustrating for new users.  The responsiveness of the AI generator could also benefit from optimization – generating a full song sometimes takes slightly longer than expected, especially with more complex prompts. Visual feedback during the generation process would be valuable.</p>\n<h2>Value for Money</h2>\n<p>As a free app, Soniva offers incredible value. The core functionality—the AI song generator—is completely free to use, allowing users to experiment extensively without any financial commitment.  While premium features or subscriptions are hinted at within the app&#39;s UI (suggesting potential future monetization), the current offering represents exceptional value for anyone interested in exploring this technology.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>AI Song Maker: Soniva Music is a promising and surprisingly effective tool for generating music using artificial intelligence. Its intuitive interface, rapid song generation speed, and free price point make it an excellent entry point into the world of AI-powered music creation. While inconsistencies in song quality and limitations in instrument control currently hold it back from being a truly polished product, the app’s core concept is strong and holds significant potential for future development.  Soniva isn&#39;t going to replace professional musicians anytime soon, but it <em>is</em> a fantastic tool for hobbyists, songwriters seeking inspiration, or anyone curious about exploring the intersection of AI and music. We rate it 4.2/5 – a solid recommendation with room for improvement.</p>"
