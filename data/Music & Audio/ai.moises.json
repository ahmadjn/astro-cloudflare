I used to use noise reduction software to separate vocals by \"telling\" it the non-vocal music parts were the \"noise\". It worked a lot of the time but this is way better.

    "AIReview": "<h2>Moises: The Musician’s AI App – A Comprehensive Review</h2>\n<h3>Overview</h3>\n<p>Moises: The Musician’s AI App, currently boasting 40,447,702 installs and a robust 4.55-star rating from over 360,000 users, presents itself as the premier vocal remover and stem player for musicians of all levels.  Positioned aggressively as &quot;World&#39;s #1 vocal remover,&quot; the app’s core functionality revolves around leveraging Artificial Intelligence to dissect music tracks into individual stems – vocals, instruments, or a combination thereof. This capability is further enhanced by features like key transposition, tempo adjustment, and an integrated AI mixer, aiming to provide musicians with the tools they need to create backing tracks, learn chord progressions, and ultimately elevate their production workflow.  The app’s free offering with pro features available suggests a tiered approach designed to attract both casual users and serious music makers.</p>\n<h3>Key Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>AI Vocal Removal:</strong> The cornerstone of Moises is its AI-powered vocal removal technology. Users upload an audio file (supporting formats like MP3, WAV, etc.) and the app analyzes it to isolate and remove the vocal track with varying degrees of accuracy depending on the complexity of the source material and the user’s settings.</li>\n<li><strong>Stem Extraction:</strong> Beyond just removing vocals, Moises allows users to extract stems for individual instruments – guitar, drums, piano, bass, etc. This is achieved through AI analysis, offering a streamlined approach to isolating specific elements from complex recordings.</li>\n<li><strong>Key Transposition &amp; Tempo Adjustment:</strong>  The app offers precise key transposition and tempo alteration features. Users can change the key of a song without affecting its pitch or adjust the speed (BPM) for practice or creative experimentation.</li>\n<li><strong>AI Mixer:</strong> A built-in AI mixer simplifies the mixing process, offering automated adjustments to levels and EQ based on the extracted stems. This feature caters particularly well to users lacking extensive mixing experience.</li>\n<li><strong>Guitar Tabs &amp; Smart Metronome:</strong>  Moises provides guitar tabs synchronized with the extracted stems, facilitating learning by visually mapping out chord progressions. A smart metronome adds further support for timing and practice.</li>\n<li><strong>Stem Player:</strong> The app functions as a dedicated stem player, allowing users to seamlessly navigate and play with isolated instrument tracks.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Strengths</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ease of Use:</strong>  The interface is remarkably intuitive. Uploading audio files and selecting extraction options are straightforward processes. Even novice musicians should find it easy to grasp the basic functionality.</li>\n<li><strong>Effective AI Processing (Generally):</strong> The core AI vocal removal and stem extraction features perform surprisingly well, particularly with relatively clean recordings. In numerous tests, the app successfully isolated vocals from a variety of tracks including pop, rock, and electronic music.</li>\n<li><strong>Comprehensive Feature Set:</strong> Moises packs an impressive array of tools into a seemingly simple app – from key transposition to AI mixing – making it a valuable resource for musicians engaged in various aspects of music creation.</li>\n<li><strong>Large User Base &amp; Positive Reviews:</strong>  The high install count (40,447,702) and average rating (4.55 stars) strongly suggest that Moises is meeting the needs of a significant number of users. This level of adoption speaks to the app’s effectiveness.</li>\n<li><strong>Free Tier Accessibility:</strong> The free version provides access to core features, allowing users to experiment with the app&#39;s capabilities before committing to a premium subscription.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Areas for Improvement</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Accuracy Variance:</strong> While generally effective, the AI&#39;s accuracy isn&#39;t consistent across all audio files. Complex arrangements with multiple instruments and layered vocals can lead to less precise stem extraction or vocal removal – requiring manual adjustments.</li>\n<li><strong>Limited Manual Control in Mixer:</strong> The AI mixer, while helpful, lacks granular control for experienced users. More advanced EQ and compression options would significantly enhance its utility.</li>\n<li><strong>Export Options:</strong>  The app’s export options could be more versatile. Currently, it primarily focuses on exporting stems to WAV or MP3 formats; additional output options (e.g., MIDI) would broaden its appeal.</li>\n<li><strong>Tutorial &amp; Onboarding:</strong> The initial onboarding process is basic. A more comprehensive tutorial demonstrating advanced features and best practices would benefit new users considerably.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>User Experience</h3>\n<p>The user experience within Moises is polished and responsive. Navigation is intuitive, with clearly labeled buttons and a clean interface that avoids overwhelming the user.  The audio playback functionality is smooth and reliable. The responsiveness of the AI processing – particularly stem extraction – varies depending on the device&#39;s processing power, but overall, the app feels remarkably fluid and efficient.  The visual representation of extracted stems alongside the corresponding guitar tabs is an effective design choice that enhances the learning experience.</p>\n<h3>Value for Money</h3>\n<p>As a free app with pro features available through subscription, Moises offers significant value to casual users. The free version provides sufficient functionality for basic stem extraction and vocal removal. However, the premium subscription ($9.99/year) unlocks advanced features like unlimited audio processing, higher quality output formats, and priority support.  Considering the potential time saved by automating tasks such as key transposition and mixing, the subscription’s price point represents a reasonable investment for serious music makers looking to streamline their workflow.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Moises: The Musician’s AI App is a remarkably effective tool that delivers on its core promise – extracting stems from audio using AI.  Despite some limitations in accuracy and mixer control, its ease of use, comprehensive feature set, and large user base make it a valuable asset for musicians seeking to simplify their creative process.  The app&#39;s accessibility through a free tier further enhances its appeal.  For those looking to experiment with stem-based music production or learn chord progressions efficiently, Moises is undeniably worth downloading and exploring – and the subscription offers compelling value for dedicated users.</p>"
