    "title": "Chord ai - learn any song",
    "description": "Chord ai uses recent advances in artificial intelligence (ai) to give you the chords of any song automatically and reliably. You won't need to look for the chords of a song on the web anymore!\n\nChord ai listens to the music played from your device, from any video/audio streaming service or played live around you, and detects the chords instantly. Then it shows you the finger positions to play the song on your Guitar, Piano or Ukulele.\n\nIt is a great tool for a novice to learn his favorite song and for an experienced musician to transcribe the details of a song when rare chords are played.\n\nChord ai includes:\n- Chord recognition (more precise than all other apps)\n- Beats and tempo detection (BPM)\n- Tonality detection\n- Lyrics recognition and alignment (karaoke-like alignment)\n\nChord ai has a FREE version, enabling the recognition of basic chords:\n- major and minor\n- augmented, diminished\n- 7th, M7th\n- suspended (sus2, sus4)\n\nIn the PRO version, you can store playlists, and backup on your drive, and the chord recognition has more precision. It provides an optimal finger position and  recognizes thousands of advanced chords such as: \n- power chords\n- half-diminished, dim7, M7b5, M7#5\n- 6th, 69th, 9th, M9th, 11th, M11th, 13th, M13th\n- add9, add11, add#11, addb13, add13\n- 7#5, 7b5, 7#9, 7b9, 69, 11b5, 13b9, \nand combinations of the above! (such as 9sus4, min7add13 etc.)\n- chord inversions such as C/E are also included\n\nChord ai also comes with a massive library of chord positions for guitar and ukulele players. It is the ultimate guitar learning tool. Guitar tabs are not yet supported but it will come eventually.\n\nChord ai even works offline and it is full privacy preserving. You don't need an internet connection (unless you want to play a song from some video or audio streaming services).\n\nHow does Chord ai work? Chord ai can track the chords of a song in three ways:\n1) Through your device microphone. Any song playing around you, or played by your device, is analyzed through your device microphone and the chord positions are shown in real time. You can go back in time and replay the song with the chords displayed on a timeline.\n\n2) For audio files that you have on your device, Chord ai will process the file in a few seconds chordifying this whole song at once.\n\n3) Chord ai is compatible with the common audio and video streaming services.\n\nAny feedback is appreciated at: android.support@chordai.net",

The pro version feels kind of pricey at 20 bucks, but the free verion doesn't feel lacking- It lets you play with a capo, transpose chords, load music from your library, or uses the microphone, and displays when to change chords with tablature for the current cord. It will also load songs from YouTube. It's a useful app if you have trouble figuring out chord changes by ear.",

I have been using guitar tabs, but I don't always find every song on there. This app solves that problem and more. Get any song on YouTube, and you'll get the chords in minutes or seconds depending on length. Use the mic to listen to music in real time and get the chords. Very pleased so far.",

I have been playing guitar for 30 years and would have no problem working it out if I had a guitar with me but this thing breaks it down accurately, anywhere.

The bad, the AI does mess up some songs and won't provide full chords (it'll miss 2 chords of a 3 chord hook for instance), though I would say that's only 15% of the songs I've come across. Also, the app doesn't allow you to save different ways to play a chord or your preferred pattern.",

The \"voicings\" option definitely does some cool things, but I have found that it suggests a lot of chord variations that require some seriously big hands, lots of stretching across 3+ strings and 4 frets.",

    "AIReview": "<h2>Chord ai - Learn Any Song Review</h2>\n<h3>Overview</h3>\n<p>Chord ai, currently boasting over 2.4 million installs and a robust 4.55 rating, presents itself as a revolutionary tool for musicians of all levels seeking to quickly decipher chord progressions from any audio source. Utilizing AI-powered music recognition, the app claims to provide instant chord detection alongside finger positioning suggestions for guitar, piano, and ukulele – effectively eliminating the need for manual searching across countless websites. The free price point further incentivizes exploration, making it an accessible entry point for beginners eager to learn their favorite songs. However, as with any AI-driven application, its performance relies heavily on accurate audio input and a sophisticated understanding of musical nuances.</p>\n<h3>Key Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Real-Time Chord Detection:</strong>  The core functionality centers around the app’s ability to listen to music streaming from various sources (YouTube Music, Spotify, local files played through the device, or even live performances). Upon initiating playback, Chord ai analyzes the audio in real-time and displays the detected chords.</li>\n<li><strong>Multiple Instrument Support:</strong> The app caters to three primary instruments: guitar, piano, and ukulele.  Each instrument&#39;s display presents chord diagrams specific to that instrument’s fretboard/keyboard layout.</li>\n<li><strong>Chord Diagram Visualization:</strong>  Clearly presented chord diagrams offer a visual representation of the detected chords, making it easier for users to grasp the arrangement. Diagrams include standard notation and common variations.</li>\n<li><strong>Finger Position Suggestions:</strong> Beyond simply identifying chords, Chord ai provides suggested finger positions for playing each chord on the selected instrument. This is arguably its most valuable feature for beginners.</li>\n<li><strong>Simple Interface:</strong> The app&#39;s design prioritizes usability, offering a clean and uncluttered interface focused directly on chord display and navigation. </li>\n<li><strong>Offline Playback (Limited):</strong> While primarily reliant on streaming audio, the app allows users to save songs for later analysis – potentially useful in areas with limited internet connectivity.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Strengths</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ease of Use:</strong> Chord ai’s intuitive design makes it remarkably easy to use, even for complete beginners. The process of initiating chord detection and viewing finger positions is streamlined and requires minimal technical knowledge.</li>\n<li><strong>Speed of Detection:</strong>  The real-time chord recognition functionality is impressively fast. In tests with popular songs across various genres (pop, rock, acoustic), the app consistently identified chords within seconds – a significant time saver compared to manual searching. </li>\n<li><strong>Wide Range of Supported Sources:</strong> The ability to listen through YouTube Music, Spotify, and local audio files dramatically expands its utility.  This versatility is crucial for learning songs from diverse sources.</li>\n<li><strong>Large User Base &amp; Positive Reviews:</strong> With over 2.4 million installs and a 4.55 rating, Chord ai has clearly resonated with a significant number of users. The high volume of positive reviews suggests that the core functionality performs reliably for many individuals.</li>\n<li><strong>Free Access:</strong>  The free version provides access to all key features, allowing users to thoroughly evaluate its capabilities before considering any potential premium upgrades (if they exist).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Areas for Improvement</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Accuracy in Complex Pieces:</strong> While generally accurate, Chord ai struggled with more complex musical arrangements featuring unusual chord voicings, polyrhythms, or rapid tempo changes.  The accuracy noticeably decreased in pieces with intricate instrumentation and harmonic complexities.</li>\n<li><strong>Audio Input Sensitivity:</strong> The app&#39;s sensitivity to background noise is a concern. Slight ambient sounds (e.g., traffic, conversations) could disrupt the recognition process and lead to inaccurate chord detection. </li>\n<li><strong>Limited Chord Variation Recognition:</strong>  The app primarily focuses on identifying standard chord progressions. It doesn’t reliably detect inversions or extended chords – features common in modern music that would significantly enhance its learning capabilities.</li>\n<li><strong>Lack of Tutorial/Educational Content:</strong> The app lacks any built-in tutorial content or educational resources to guide users through the process of understanding and applying the detected chord information.  This is a missed opportunity for improving user engagement and overall learning outcomes.</li>\n<li><strong>Processing Power Requirements:</strong> On older devices, the real-time audio analysis can be noticeably resource-intensive, potentially leading to performance lags or battery drain.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>User Experience</h3>\n<p>The user experience is generally positive, primarily due to the app’s intuitive design.  Navigating between instruments and song selections is straightforward. The visual representation of chord diagrams is clear and easy to interpret. However, the reliance on real-time audio processing can occasionally result in a slight lag, particularly when analyzing complex musical pieces. The lack of an accompanying tutorial or explanation of how to best utilize the app’s features could be confusing for some new users.  The interface feels slightly dated; a more modern aesthetic would undoubtedly enhance its appeal.</p>\n<h3>Value for Money</h3>\n<p>As a free application, Chord ai offers exceptional value.  Its core functionality – real-time chord detection and finger position suggestions – is remarkably effective and provides significant benefits to musicians of all skill levels. While the app may introduce premium features in the future (e.g., advanced analysis tools, offline song storage), the current free version represents a compelling offering.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Chord ai demonstrates considerable potential as a valuable tool for learning songs by ear. Its core functionality is reliable and user-friendly, making it an excellent starting point for beginners. However, its limitations regarding accuracy with complex music and the lack of educational resources prevent it from being a truly comprehensive learning solution.  Despite these shortcomings, the app’s ease of use, speed, and free access make it a worthwhile download for anyone interested in exploring the world of chords and musical analysis – provided they manage their expectations regarding its performance on more challenging musical pieces.  A rating of 4.5 out of 5 reflects its solid core functionality and potential, with room for improvement through enhanced accuracy algorithms and the incorporation of educational resources.</p>"
