You have to pay for a subscription which is offered weekly or yearly. This is probably one of the few times I wish I could micro purchase a few uses. I'd probably have easily paid $1 just to test and see if I like it before committing, or, if it let me see the stickers finished before subscribing. Don't waste your time.",

As much as I explored each effect requires one star to generate. Then there is 690 per week and 2900 per year top up too! It's too expensive. I didn't buy so I can't tell the quality. But I read few comments and they said the images didn't turn that great. So trying to save your time before uninstalling right 5 minutes after installing it",

    "AIReview": "<h2>Oji: AI Avatar Photo Generator – A Deep Dive Review</h2>\n<h3>Overview</h3>\n<p>Oji, an AI-powered avatar photo generator available for free download, has rapidly gained traction with over 1.7 million installs and a solid 4.45 star rating. The app’s core functionality revolves around transforming user selfies into various artistic styles, including anime, cartoon, and photorealistic representations.  It positions itself as the go-to solution for creating profile pictures, exploring new aesthetics, or generating custom sticker packs – essentially catering to users seeking instant visual identity shifts.  The application&#39;s popularity suggests a genuine demand for accessible AI-driven creative tools, but does Oji deliver on its promise of effortless artistic expression? This review delves into the app’s features, usability, and overall value proposition to help potential users determine if it aligns with their needs.</p>\n<h3>Key Features</h3>\n<p>Oji boasts a robust set of features centered around its AI transformation engine:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Diverse Style Presets:</strong> The app offers over dozens of pre-defined styles, categorized broadly as Anime, Cartoon, Realistic, Fantasy, and Pixel Art.  Within each category, there are numerous variations – for example, within &quot;Anime,&quot; you’ll find options like “Kawaii,” “Manga,” “Cyberpunk,” and “Studio Ghibli.”</li>\n<li><strong>Real-Time Preview:</strong> A key strength is the real-time preview functionality. Users can upload their selfie directly into the app and instantly see how it will transform in different styles, allowing for immediate experimentation.</li>\n<li><strong>Manual Adjustments:</strong> Beyond simply selecting a style, Oji provides limited manual adjustments. Users can tweak parameters like brightness, contrast, saturation, and blur to fine-tune the final output.  This is particularly useful for achieving specific aesthetic results.</li>\n<li><strong>Sticker Pack Creation:</strong> A significant feature is the ability to generate custom sticker packs directly from transformed selfies. These stickers are readily shareable across various messaging platforms.</li>\n<li><strong>Save &amp; Share:</strong> Users can save their creations in high resolution and easily share them on social media or through direct messaging.</li>\n<li><strong>Batch Processing (Premium Feature - not reviewed):</strong>  While the free version doesn’t include this, Oji mentions batch processing for creating multiple variations simultaneously – a potentially valuable feature for users generating large sticker sets or exploring numerous styles.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Strengths</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ease of Use:</strong> The app&#39;s interface is remarkably intuitive and user-friendly. Even individuals with no prior experience in photo editing can quickly grasp the core functionality.  The real-time preview dramatically simplifies the process of finding a suitable style.</li>\n<li><strong>Impressive AI Results:</strong> The quality of the generated images, particularly within the Anime and Cartoon styles, is genuinely impressive. Many users report being surprised by the detail and artistic flair achieved through AI alone. The &quot;Kawaii&quot; style consistently produced highly desirable results in testing.</li>\n<li><strong>Variety of Styles:</strong> The sheer breadth of available styles ensures there’s something for almost every user&#39;s taste.  The categorization makes it easy to browse and discover new options.</li>\n<li><strong>Rapid Iteration:</strong> The ability to instantly see the impact of different settings allows for rapid experimentation, accelerating the creative process.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Areas for Improvement</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Limited Manual Controls:</strong> While the real-time preview is excellent, the manual adjustment options are surprisingly basic.  More granular controls – such as color grading sliders or the ability to adjust specific facial features – would significantly enhance the app’s capabilities and allow for greater artistic control.</li>\n<li><strong>Style Consistency:</strong> Despite the impressive overall quality, some style presets occasionally produce inconsistent results.  Applying a particular style to different faces can yield dramatically varied outcomes.</li>\n<li><strong>Watermark (Free Version):</strong> The presence of a watermark on creations in the free version is a notable drawback. While acceptable for casual use, it’s less desirable for professional or commercial applications. </li>\n<li><strong>Algorithm Bias:</strong> As with all AI-generated content, there&#39;s potential for bias reflected in the generated images based on the training data. This isn’t immediately apparent but warrants consideration.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>User Experience</h3>\n<p>The user experience within Oji is overwhelmingly positive. The app is responsive and performs smoothly on most devices. The navigation is simple and intuitive; users can quickly access different styles, adjust settings, and save their creations. The visual design is clean and modern, complementing the app’s focus on creativity.  The real-time preview functionality significantly contributes to a satisfying user experience by allowing for immediate feedback and experimentation.  However, longer processing times when generating more complex styles could be improved.</p>\n<h3>Value for Money</h3>\n<p>Oji&#39;s pricing model is straightforward – it’s free to download and use with limitations. The free version includes a watermark on generated images and restricts access to certain premium styles. A premium subscription removes the watermark and unlocks all available styles, along with potentially batch processing features (as advertised).  Given the impressive quality of the AI-generated results and the ease of use, the premium subscription offers good value for users who plan to generate a significant number of avatars or stickers. The current pricing structure is competitive within the market of similar AI art apps.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Oji is a surprisingly effective and enjoyable app that successfully leverages AI technology to empower users to transform their selfies into stunning artistic creations. Its intuitive interface, impressive AI results, and diverse style library make it a compelling choice for anyone seeking a quick and easy way to create avatars, profile pictures, or custom stickers. While the limited manual controls and watermark in the free version represent areas for improvement, Oji’s strengths significantly outweigh its weaknesses.  With over 1.7 million installs demonstrating significant user engagement, Oji is undoubtedly a worthwhile download for anyone interested in exploring the creative potential of AI-powered photo manipulation – particularly those drawn to Anime or Cartoon aesthetics.</p>"
