Then with one click, I was able to switch to only the background. AMAZING. EFFORTLESS. Without masking anything! I applied an AI ring in the wrong position and DoFoto is the ONLY app ive seen that allows you to reposition an AI filter intuitively. That is the GOLD STANDARD now that other apps must live up to.

    "AIReview": "<h2>Photo Editor: Retouch, Enhance ‚Äì A Detailed Review</h2>\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>Photo Editor: Retouch, Enhance, developed by DoFoto, presents itself as a comprehensive free face photo editing app aimed at users seeking quick and easy enhancements to their portraits. With over 9.4 million installs and a robust 4.79 rating from nearly 72,000 users, the app has clearly established itself within the crowded photography editing landscape. The core promise ‚Äì ‚Äústunning photos with unlimited creativity!‚Äù ‚Äì is supported by a suite of features including an AI Retouch &amp; Face Editor, an AI Photo Enhancer, aesthetic filters, and even a Pic Collage Maker.  This review will delve into these features to assess whether DoFoto truly delivers on its ambitious claims.</p>\n<h2>Key Features</h2>\n<p>The app‚Äôs feature set is intentionally broad, reflecting the ‚Äúall-in-one‚Äù marketing approach. Here&#39;s a breakdown of the key elements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>AI Retouch &amp; Face Editor:</strong> This is arguably the centerpiece of the app. It allows users to manipulate facial features with surprising precision.  Adjustments include smoothing skin, reshaping the jawline, altering eye size and shape, and even adjusting nose dimensions. The AI component purportedly assists in making these adjustments feel more natural than traditional sliders would.</li>\n<li><strong>AI Photo Enhancer:</strong> This feature utilizes artificial intelligence to automatically improve photo quality ‚Äì boosting brightness, contrast, sharpness, and color saturation. It‚Äôs designed for quickly elevating low-resolution or poorly lit images.</li>\n<li><strong>Aesthetic Filters &amp; AI Effects:</strong> A selection of pre-designed filters are available, categorized by style (e.g., vintage, black and white, artistic).  The ‚ÄúAI effects‚Äù are a newer addition that supposedly leverages AI to add dynamic overlays and enhancements beyond traditional filters. Examples include adding bokeh or simulated light leaks.</li>\n<li><strong>Perfect Body Editor:</strong> This feature is specifically designed for altering body shapes ‚Äì primarily targeting the waist, hips, and arms.</li>\n<li><strong>Face Retouch App:</strong> A dedicated tool focused solely on refining facial features.</li>\n<li><strong>Pic Collage Maker:</strong> Allows users to create collages by combining multiple photos with various layouts and stickers.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Strengths</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ease of Use:</strong> The app‚Äôs interface is remarkably intuitive.  The layout is clean, and the controls are logically arranged, making it accessible even for novice photo editors. Navigating between features is straightforward.</li>\n<li><strong>Effective AI Retouching (Initially):</strong> The AI-powered face editor demonstrates considerable potential in quickly smoothing skin and making subtle adjustments to facial features. The results can be impressive with minimal effort ‚Äì especially for users new to advanced editing techniques.</li>\n<li><strong>Photo Enhancement Capabilities:</strong> The AI Photo Enhancer is genuinely effective at improving the overall quality of photos, particularly those with poor lighting or low resolution.  It‚Äôs a convenient tool for quickly boosting images before sharing them online.</li>\n<li><strong>High Install Numbers &amp; Positive Rating:</strong> The immense popularity (9.4 million installs) and high rating (4.79/5) suggest that the app addresses a significant user need, and many users find it valuable.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Areas for Improvement</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>AI Over-Reliance:</strong> While the AI tools are effective, they can sometimes produce overly smoothed or unnatural results if not used carefully. Users should be mindful of this and manually adjust settings as needed to avoid an artificial look.</li>\n<li><strong>Filter Variety &amp; Quality:</strong>  While there‚Äôs a decent selection of filters, some feel generic and lack distinct character. The quality of the AI effects is inconsistent; some are impressive, while others appear somewhat gimmicky.</li>\n<li><strong>Limited Manual Control:</strong> Compared to more sophisticated photo editing apps, DoFoto offers limited manual control over key parameters like shadows, highlights, and curves.  This can be frustrating for users who prefer a hands-on approach.</li>\n<li><strong>‚ÄúPerfect Body Editor‚Äù ‚Äì Potential for Misuse:</strong> The ‚ÄúPerfect Body Editor‚Äù is arguably the most problematic feature, given the potential for promoting unrealistic beauty standards. Clearer disclaimers regarding its use are needed.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>User Experience</h2>\n<p>The user experience is generally smooth and responsive.  Image loading times are reasonable, and transitions between features are seamless. The app‚Äôs performance remains stable even when applying multiple filters or effects simultaneously. The touch controls are well-optimized, providing accurate and predictable responses. However, the abundance of options can occasionally feel overwhelming to new users. A guided tutorial would greatly improve onboarding.</p>\n<h2>Value for Money</h2>\n<p>As a free app with no in-app purchases (that I could find during testing), DoFoto offers excellent value for money. The core features ‚Äì including the AI Retouch &amp; Face Editor, Photo Enhancer, and filter collection ‚Äì are fully accessible without any restrictions.  This makes it an attractive option for anyone looking to easily enhance their photos on a budget.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Photo Editor: Retouch, Enhance is a surprisingly capable free photo editing app that delivers impressive results thanks to its AI-powered tools. While the app isn&#39;t perfect‚Äîparticularly concerning filter variety and some potential issues with the AI ‚Äì it‚Äôs an excellent choice for users seeking a simple, intuitive way to enhance their photos quickly and effectively. The high install numbers and positive rating are well-deserved, indicating that DoFoto has successfully met the needs of a large audience. It&#39;s a solid entry point into photo editing for beginners and a convenient tool for casual photographers who want to make quick improvements on the go.  I would rate it 4 out of 5 stars.</p>"
