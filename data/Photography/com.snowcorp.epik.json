When m working on two different layers n I start to work on 2nd layer, the changes I made on it, it affects on the background also which is wrong, so I can't use it for multiple layers..... Also, when I remove unwanted element it should clean it fine instead it leaves smudges. Pls fix these problems. I have to uninstall it for now. Thank you",

It's so cool to see the transformation of my photos with just a few tweaks. I highly recommend this app.....",

    "AIReview": "<h2>EPIK - AI Photo &amp; Video Editor Review</h2>\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>EPIK ‚Äì AI Photo &amp; Video Editor is an ambitious offering in the crowded mobile photo editing landscape, promising professional-grade tools powered by artificial intelligence. With a staggering 71,053,083 installs and a robust 4.416 rating from over 623,027 users, EPIK has clearly resonated with a large audience seeking convenient and intelligent image manipulation solutions. The app‚Äôs core proposition revolves around simplifying complex editing tasks through AI, allowing users ‚Äì regardless of their technical skill level ‚Äì to achieve polished results quickly.  The fact that it supports RAW files further distinguishes it, appealing to serious photographers who demand maximum control over their images. This review delves into the functionality and user experience of EPIK, assessing its strengths, weaknesses, and ultimately, determining if it justifies its free price tag.</p>\n<h2>Key Features</h2>\n<p>EPIK boasts a comprehensive suite of editing features categorized around both AI-powered tools and traditional photo/video adjustments. Let‚Äôs break down the key offerings:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>AI Enhancement:</strong> This is arguably the headline feature, utilizing AI to automatically improve clarity, resolution, and overall quality of photos. The ‚ÄúEnhance‚Äù tool promises dramatically improved results with minimal user input ‚Äì a significant time-saver for quick edits.</li>\n<li><strong>AI Skin Correction:</strong> Targeting blemish removal and skin smoothing, this feature leverages AI to subtly refine portraits, addressing a common pain point for users sharing images on social media.</li>\n<li><strong>Smart AI Cutout:</strong> This tool distinguishes itself through its ability to precisely isolate subjects ‚Äì including figures, objects, and even animals ‚Äì offering a far more intuitive solution than traditional selection tools.  The accuracy of this feature is crucial to its success.</li>\n<li><strong>Remove Tool:</strong> A straightforward object removal tool powered by AI, allowing users to seamlessly erase unwanted elements from their images.</li>\n<li><strong>AI Filter &amp; Style Creation:</strong> Users can explore and experiment with diverse styles using the ‚ÄúAI filter‚Äù feature, or even create entirely new looks based on existing ones. This includes options for generating stylized characters ‚Äì a potentially engaging feature for creative experimentation.</li>\n<li><strong>Hairstyle &amp; Expression Transformation:</strong>  This unique tool allows users to digitally alter hairstyles and facial expressions, effectively creating &quot;what if&quot; scenarios with their photos. </li>\n<li><strong>Traditional Photo Editing Tools:</strong> Alongside the AI features, EPIK includes standard editing tools such as brightness, contrast, saturation adjustments, cropping, rotating, and applying various filters.</li>\n<li><strong>Video Editing Capabilities:</strong> The app extends beyond still images, offering basic video editing functionality including trimming, merging clips, and adding music.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Strengths</h2>\n<p>Several aspects of EPIK contribute to its popularity:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ease of Use:</strong>  The AI-powered features significantly reduce the learning curve for new users. Tasks that would typically require extensive knowledge of photo editing are simplified with a single tap.</li>\n<li><strong>Powerful AI Engine:</strong> The underlying AI algorithms, particularly in the cutout and enhancement tools, demonstrate impressive accuracy and effectiveness. The ‚ÄòSmart AI Cutout‚Äô is notably superior to many competing apps.</li>\n<li><strong>Broad Feature Set:</strong> The combination of AI and traditional editing tools provides users with considerable flexibility in achieving their desired results. Support for RAW files adds a professional dimension.</li>\n<li><strong>Large User Base &amp; Positive Reviews:</strong>  The app&#39;s high install count and average rating indicate widespread satisfaction amongst its user base, suggesting solid core functionality.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Areas for Improvement</h2>\n<p>Despite its strengths, EPIK isn‚Äôt without areas needing refinement:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>AI Processing Speed:</strong> At times, the AI processing can feel sluggish, particularly when utilizing complex features like the Smart AI Cutout.  Faster performance would dramatically improve the workflow.</li>\n<li><strong>Filter Customization Limitations:</strong> While the AI filter feature is interesting, its customization options could be expanded to allow for more precise control over stylistic effects. Users desire greater creative freedom.</li>\n<li><strong>Video Editing Depth:</strong> The video editing capabilities are relatively basic compared to dedicated video editing apps.  More advanced features such as color grading and audio mixing would greatly enhance this aspect.</li>\n<li><strong>Tutorials &amp; Onboarding:</strong> While the app is generally easy to use, a more comprehensive onboarding tutorial could better highlight the capabilities of each feature, especially the AI tools.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>User Experience</h2>\n<p>The user interface (UI) of EPIK is clean, modern, and intuitive. The layout is logically organized, separating the AI features from traditional editing tools for easier navigation. Swiping gestures are employed effectively throughout the app, facilitating smooth transitions between different functionalities.  The visual feedback provided by the AI tools ‚Äì real-time previews ‚Äì are crucial to user confidence and allows immediate adjustments. However, occasional UI glitches or minor lag could detract slightly from the overall experience.</p>\n<h2>Value for Money</h2>\n<p>EPIK is offered entirely free of charge, a significant advantage in a market dominated by paid photo editing apps. This makes it an accessible option for anyone looking to explore AI-powered image enhancement without financial commitment. The reliance on advertising within the free version is relatively minimal and doesn&#39;t significantly disrupt the user experience.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>EPIK ‚Äì AI Photo &amp; Video Editor represents a compelling entry in the mobile photo editing space. Its powerful AI tools, combined with a user-friendly interface and broad feature set, make it a viable alternative to established competitors, particularly for users seeking an accessible introduction to intelligent image manipulation. While improvements could be made in processing speed and filter customization, the app‚Äôs strengths ‚Äì especially its Smart AI Cutout ‚Äì significantly outweigh its shortcomings.  Given that it&#39;s completely free, EPIK is undoubtedly worth downloading and exploring; it&#39;s a solid choice for both casual users and those looking to experiment with cutting-edge photo editing technology.  The continued popularity of the app suggests it‚Äôs meeting a genuine demand within the market.</p>"
