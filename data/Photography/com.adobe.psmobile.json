The only complaint I have is when making a collage, trying to zoom without rotating is irritatingly difficult af. There should be an option to fit/fill the pic to the frame like other apps have, if there was one I couldn't find it. Also not having the blue frame around ur selection in collage mode. It blocks the background.",

    "AIReview": "<h2>Photoshop Express Photo Editor Review – A Solid Choice for Casual Editing</h2>\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>Photoshop Express, developed by Adobe, is a mobile photo editor designed to bring powerful image editing capabilities to users of all skill levels. With over 282 million installs and an impressive average rating of 4.5 stars, the app has clearly resonated with a massive audience seeking a convenient way to enhance their photos on-the-go. The core premise – “PHOTO EDITING MADE FUN AND EASY” – is ambitious, aiming to demystify professional photo editing tools for everyday users.  The free version offers an extensive suite of features, and the inclusion of AI image generation adds another layer of functionality. This review delves into whether Photoshop Express truly delivers on its promise and assesses its strengths, weaknesses, user experience, and overall value.</p>\n<h2>Key Features</h2>\n<p>Photoshop Express boasts a remarkably comprehensive feature set, designed to cover a broad range of editing needs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>One-Tap Edits:</strong> The app’s signature feature allows users to quickly apply pre-defined enhancements like “Vibrant,” “Vintage,” or “Black &amp; White” with a single tap.</li>\n<li><strong>Manual Adjustments:</strong> Beyond the one-tap options, users have granular control over exposure, contrast, highlights, shadows, warmth, and tint.  Sliders provide precise adjustments for nuanced editing.</li>\n<li><strong>Retouching Tools:</strong> A dedicated retouching suite includes tools for removing blemishes, smoothing skin, reshaping teeth, and adjusting eye color – essential for selfie enhancements.</li>\n<li><strong>Text &amp; Stickers:</strong> Users can add text overlays with various fonts and styles, along with a library of stickers to personalize their images.</li>\n<li><strong>Collage Maker:</strong> The app’s collage maker allows users to combine multiple photos into creative layouts, offering pre-designed templates and freeform arrangement options.</li>\n<li><strong>AI Image Generator (Magic Enhance):</strong> This innovative feature uses Adobe&#39;s AI technology to automatically enhance the quality of a photo – boosting resolution, sharpening details, and improving overall color balance.  It’s surprisingly effective on a wide range of images.</li>\n<li><strong>Face Editor:</strong> An advanced tool that allows users to alter facial features like nose size, eye shape, and jawline with surprising accuracy.</li>\n<li><strong>Filters:</strong> A vast library of filters provides a quick route to different artistic styles, from classic film looks to modern effects.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Strengths</h2>\n<p>Several factors contribute to Photoshop Express&#39;s popularity:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ease of Use:</strong> The app’s intuitive interface is one of its biggest strengths.  The one-tap edits are genuinely useful for beginners, while the more advanced tools are still relatively easy to master.</li>\n<li><strong>Powerful AI Integration:</strong> The Magic Enhance feature is a standout innovation. It consistently produces impressive results, often dramatically improving the look of low-resolution or poorly lit photos without requiring significant manual adjustments.  The AI face editor is similarly effective and fun to experiment with.</li>\n<li><strong>Broad Feature Set:</strong> The sheer number of tools available within the free version is remarkable. Users have access to a professional-level editing suite without paying a penny.</li>\n<li><strong>Performance &amp; Stability:</strong> Despite its complexity, Photoshop Express runs smoothly on most devices and rarely crashes or freezes. Adobe’s optimization efforts are clearly evident.</li>\n<li><strong>Large User Base &amp; Support:</strong>  The massive user base translates into abundant online tutorials, forums, and support resources readily available to help users troubleshoot issues and learn new techniques.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Areas for Improvement</h2>\n<p>Despite its strengths, Photoshop Express isn&#39;t without shortcomings:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Interface Clutter:</strong> The abundance of features can lead to a somewhat cluttered interface, particularly for novice users who may be overwhelmed by the options.  A more streamlined layout could improve usability.</li>\n<li><strong>Limited RAW Support:</strong> Currently, the app doesn’t natively support RAW image formats, restricting its capabilities when working with professional cameras. This is a notable omission given Adobe&#39;s history in photography.</li>\n<li><strong>Watermark (Premium):</strong> While the free version is generous, it adds a subtle watermark to exported images.  Removing this watermark requires subscribing to the premium version.</li>\n<li><strong>Advanced Layer Support:</strong> The app lacks true layer support, limiting complex editing workflows that professional photographers rely on.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>User Experience</h2>\n<p>The user experience within Photoshop Express is generally positive, especially considering its accessibility. The onboarding process is straightforward and guides users through the basic features.  Navigation is primarily achieved through a bottom navigation bar offering quick access to key tools. Swiping gestures are utilized for various actions like zooming and adjusting sliders. The app’s responsiveness is commendable, ensuring smooth transitions between editing operations. However, as mentioned previously, the interface can feel overwhelming at times, particularly when exploring the numerous settings and options.</p>\n<h2>Value for Money</h2>\n<p>Photoshop Express offers exceptional value for money due to its free availability. The feature set within the free version rivals that of many paid photo editors.  The premium subscription ($9.99/month or $49.99/year) unlocks advanced features like unlimited export resolution, removal of the watermark, access to exclusive filters and effects, and priority support. While this is a reasonable price for professionals or serious hobbyists, casual users may find the free version sufficient.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Photoshop Express Photo Editor successfully bridges the gap between accessible mobile photo editing and professional-grade capabilities. Its intuitive interface, powerful AI integration (Magic Enhance), and extensive feature set make it an excellent choice for anyone seeking to enhance their photos quickly and easily. While there are areas where improvement could be made – primarily regarding interface clutter and RAW support – the app’s strengths significantly outweigh its weaknesses. With a massive user base and a generous free version, Photoshop Express is undoubtedly one of the best photo editing apps available on mobile devices, offering exceptional value for money and empowering users to unleash their creativity.  It&#39;s a highly recommended option for both beginners and experienced photographers alike.</p>"
