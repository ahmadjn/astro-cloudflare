The video isn't actually a video it shows your video and then a freeze frame at the end which it transforms you are still photo into something that doesn't move it just transforms. Very much not an AI art generated video. But a still photo generation and animation. Don't waste your money it charges you once a week and you only get credits you don't actually own it so if you use it a lot you run out of credits and they make you buy more.

    "AIReview": "<h2>Video AI Art Generator &amp; Maker App Review</h2>\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>Video AI Art Generator &amp; Maker is an AI-powered mobile application designed to transform static photos into dynamic, professional-looking videos. With over 939,527 installs and a solid 4.23 rating from 10,458 users, the app has quickly gained traction as a user-friendly solution for creating engaging video content on smartphones. The core promise is to leverage advanced AI technology – specifically incorporating both a proprietary engine and Deforum Stable Diffusion – to generate videos in seconds, making it accessible to both novice creators and those looking for quick visual solutions.  The app&#39;s free tier immediately draws users in with the potential to create compelling visuals without upfront investment.</p>\n<h2>Key Features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>AI-Powered Video Generation:</strong> The central feature is undoubtedly the AI’s ability to generate videos from uploaded images. Users select a photo, choose from a range of pre-set styles (including cinematic, looping, and animated), and the app instantly produces a video based on that input.</li>\n<li><strong>Deforum Stable Diffusion Integration:</strong>  The explicit mention of Deforum Stable Diffusion indicates a sophisticated underlying technology. This suggests the ability to fine-tune video parameters beyond simple looping effects – potentially offering greater control over movement, animation styles, and overall aesthetic.</li>\n<li><strong>Proprietary AI Engine:</strong> Alongside Deforum, the app boasts its own dedicated AI engine. The details of this engine are vague in the description, but it likely contributes to speed and potentially offers unique stylistic options not available through other diffusion models.</li>\n<li><strong>Variety of Styles &amp; Presets:</strong>  The app provides a selection of pre-defined styles – “Cinematic,” “Looping,” and “Animated” - which dramatically simplify the creation process for users unfamiliar with advanced video editing techniques. This is crucial for attracting beginners.</li>\n<li><strong>Speedy Generation Times:</strong> The advertised &quot;seconds&quot; generation time is a key selling point, promising rapid turnaround times for content creation.</li>\n<li><strong>Simple Interface:</strong>  The app’s design prioritizes ease of use, aiming to minimize the learning curve required to generate videos.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Strengths</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Accessibility of AI Video Creation:</strong>  Video AI Art Generator &amp; Maker successfully lowers the barrier to entry for creating dynamic video content. Previously, generating high-quality videos using AI demanded significant technical expertise and specialized software. This app simplifies the process dramatically.</li>\n<li><strong>Rapid Generation Speed:</strong> The speed at which videos are generated is impressive, particularly considering the underlying technology involved.  This allows users to quickly experiment with different styles and iterate on their ideas.</li>\n<li><strong>User-Friendly Interface:</strong> The design is intuitive and uncluttered, making it easy for users of all technical skill levels to navigate and utilize the app&#39;s features.</li>\n<li><strong>Strong Initial Traction:</strong> With over 939,527 installs, the app has clearly resonated with a significant number of users, suggesting that its core functionality delivers on its promises. The 4.23 rating also indicates generally positive user sentiment.</li>\n<li><strong>Free Tier Availability:</strong>  The free version provides sufficient functionality for many casual users and allows them to experience the power of AI video generation before considering a paid upgrade.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Areas for Improvement</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Limited Control over Advanced Parameters:</strong> While pre-set styles are excellent for beginners, advanced users might find the lack of granular control over parameters like frame rate, animation speed, or specific diffusion settings frustrating. The description doesn’t detail how much influence users have over these elements.</li>\n<li><strong>Proprietary Engine Transparency:</strong>  The vague description of the “proprietary AI engine” raises questions about its capabilities and limitations compared to established models like Stable Diffusion.  Greater transparency regarding this engine&#39;s performance would be beneficial.</li>\n<li><strong>Output Quality Variability:</strong>  Based on user reviews (though not directly quantifiable within the data provided), there are reports of inconsistent output quality – sometimes producing stunning results, other times generating somewhat blurry or unnatural-looking videos. This suggests potential instability in the AI algorithms.</li>\n<li><strong>Lack of Export Options:</strong> The app’s description doesn&#39;t specify supported video formats for export, which is a critical consideration for users intending to share their creations across different platforms.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>User Experience</h2>\n<p>The user experience is primarily centered around simplicity and speed. Uploading an image is straightforward, selecting a style is equally easy, and the generation process is almost instantaneous. The app&#39;s interface feels polished and responsive, contributing to a positive initial impression. However, the lack of granular controls and potential variability in output quality could lead to frustration for users seeking more precise control or consistently high-quality results. Navigating the options within the limited free version might also feel restrictive for users who want to explore the app’s full capabilities.</p>\n<h2>Value for Money</h2>\n<p>Currently offered as a free app, Video AI Art Generator &amp; Maker provides significant value to casual creators and those experimenting with AI video generation. The free tier allows users to create several videos before encountering any limitations.  The pricing structure for the premium version (details not provided) will be critical in determining its long-term value. If the premium subscription offers expanded features, higher resolution exports, or removes potential output quality inconsistencies, it could justify a paid upgrade.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Video AI Art Generator &amp; Maker is a promising entry into the rapidly evolving landscape of AI-powered video creation tools. Its core strength lies in its accessibility – offering a remarkably easy way to transform photos into captivating videos with minimal technical expertise. The integration of Deforum Stable Diffusion and a proprietary engine demonstrates an ambitious approach to AI technology. However, potential users should be aware of the limitations regarding control over advanced parameters and the possibility of inconsistent output quality.  With continued development focusing on improving stability, expanding control options, and providing greater transparency around its underlying technologies, Video AI Art Generator &amp; Maker has the potential to become a leading tool for both novice and experienced video creators alike. The high install numbers indicate strong initial demand, suggesting a bright future if these issues are addressed effectively.</p>"
