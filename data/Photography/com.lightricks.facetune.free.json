You can pay $8/month for a few upgrades if you want. Otherwise most of it is free and much better than this app Response: to do anything you advertise, you have to pay for. You have very limited options if you don't pay. Again, i will stick and tell people about the apps that don't try to rip people off",

When I first found out about this I downloaded the free version to see if it was worth it, leading to the full version because the adds were too much. The fact that you have to pay for the app then pay to get certain features is super shady.",

Gradually became a still-fun app but with fewer and fewer features that weren't behind a paywall -- still, if you were willing to watch ads, it was worth the time. But now it's entirely paid except for a 3 day trial. Clearly the developers missed the point on what people actually like about the app. Good luck, I guess.",

    "AIReview": "<h2>Facetune: Hair, Photo Editor – A Detailed Review</h2>\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>Facetune: Hair, Photo Editor has swiftly become one of the most downloaded photo editing apps available, boasting over 82 million installs and a robust 4.4-star rating from a massive user base of 770,370 individuals. This app positions itself as the ultimate solution for enhancing selfies, portraits, and even video content – with an emphasis on hair manipulation and quick, one-tap editing.  The core proposition is accessibility: providing powerful photo retouching capabilities within a seemingly effortless interface, targeting users who desire polished images without needing extensive photographic skills or complex software. The free version offers a surprising amount of functionality, while subscription options unlock advanced features like AI skin smoothing and more granular control.</p>\n<h2>Key Features</h2>\n<p>Facetune’s feature set is layered, catering to both casual users and those seeking professional-level results. Here&#39;s a breakdown:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>One-Tap Tools:</strong> The app’s central selling point – the ability to dramatically alter your appearance with single taps – remains a core function.  This includes features like &quot;Smooth&quot; (for skin smoothing), “Eyes” (to sharpen and enlarge eyes), “Jawline” (to define the jaw), and “Nose” (for subtle adjustments).</li>\n<li><strong>Hair Editor:</strong> As indicated by the app’s name, the hair editor is exceptionally robust. It allows users to change hair color with a vast palette of options, adjust highlights and shadows, and even add volume and texture.  The precision offered here significantly surpasses many competing apps.</li>\n<li><strong>Teeth Whitening &amp; Skin Tone Adjustments:</strong> Beyond facial features, Facetune provides tools for whitening teeth, adjusting skin tone (including redness reduction), and controlling exposure and contrast.</li>\n<li><strong>Filters &amp; Effects:</strong> While not the primary focus, a selection of filters and effects are available to add stylistic flair to images. These include options for vintage looks, black and white conversions, and cinematic enhancements.</li>\n<li><strong>Video Enhancement:</strong>  Facetune extends beyond still photos, offering tools to improve video quality – primarily focusing on smoothing skin and adjusting lighting within video clips.</li>\n<li><strong>Headshot Mode:</strong> Specifically designed for professional headshots, this mode offers targeted adjustments for resume-ready images with enhanced clarity and a polished appearance.</li>\n<li><strong>AI-Powered Features (Premium):</strong> The premium subscription unlocks AI-powered features like “Skin AI,” which automatically smooths skin imperfections, and &quot;Body AI,&quot; designed to subtly reshape the body.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Strengths</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ease of Use:</strong> Facetune truly excels in its simplicity. The intuitive one-tap tools make it incredibly easy for anyone – regardless of their editing experience – to dramatically improve their photos. The visual feedback is immediate, allowing users to quickly see the impact of each adjustment.</li>\n<li><strong>Powerful Hair Editing:</strong>  The hair editor is arguably the app&#39;s strongest feature. It provides an unparalleled level of control over hair color and style, rivaling dedicated beauty applications. This functionality alone justifies a significant portion of the user base’s interest.</li>\n<li><strong>Fast Results:</strong> The one-tap tools deliver noticeable improvements almost instantly.  This speed is crucial for social media users who need to quickly refine their photos before posting.</li>\n<li><strong>Large User Base &amp; Community:</strong> With over 82 million installs, Facetune benefits from a large and active user community, offering ample opportunities for inspiration and tutorials.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Areas for Improvement</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Premium Lockout:</strong> Many of the most impactful features – particularly those leveraging AI – are locked behind the premium subscription. This can be frustrating for users who enjoy using the free version but want access to the full suite of tools.</li>\n<li><strong>Limited Filter Variety (Free):</strong> The selection of filters available in the free version is noticeably smaller than in the premium version, limiting creative options for users solely relying on the free tier.</li>\n<li><strong>Over-Smoothing Potential:</strong> While “Smooth” is a popular tool, overuse can lead to an unnatural and plastic-looking effect, particularly with skin retouching.  More granular controls regarding smoothing intensity would be beneficial.</li>\n<li><strong>Video Editing Limitations:</strong> The video editing capabilities are comparatively basic compared to dedicated video editing apps.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>User Experience</h2>\n<p>The user experience within Facetune is remarkably polished and intuitive. The interface is clean and uncluttered, making navigation effortless. The app’s responsiveness is excellent, with adjustments applied almost instantaneously.  The tutorial system, while present, isn&#39;t overly intrusive – it gently guides users through the key features without feeling overwhelming. The ability to easily switch between different editing tools and adjust their intensity contributes significantly to a positive user experience. A notable aspect is the consistent visual feedback provided by each adjustment, allowing for precise control.</p>\n<h2>Value for Money</h2>\n<p>The free version of Facetune provides considerable value, particularly for casual users who primarily want to tweak their selfies. However, to unlock the app’s full potential – specifically AI-powered features and a wider range of filters – a subscription is necessary.  Pricing varies depending on the region, but typically sits around $9.99 per month or $59.99 per year.  Considering the power of the hair editor and the convenience of one-tap tools, the premium subscription represents a reasonable investment for serious users who regularly edit photos and videos. The annual subscription offers the best overall value.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Facetune: Hair, Photo Editor is a remarkably effective photo editing app that delivers on its promise of effortless beauty enhancement.  Its intuitive interface, powerful hair editor, and fast results make it an appealing option for a broad range of users – from social media enthusiasts to those creating professional headshots. While the premium subscription model may deter some, the core functionality within the free version is robust enough for many needs. The app’s success underscores the growing demand for accessible and effective photo editing tools in a mobile environment.  Despite needing some minor improvements regarding feature availability and potentially refining the AI smoothing algorithm, Facetune remains a top contender in the photography category and deserves its high rating.</p>"
