The most recent decision to change the GUI was annoying, but not impossible to overcome. However the VIDEO ads after every edit were not. It took forever to edit a handful of photos, some ads were unskippable and wasting my time and data. I suggest anyone considering the app to move on. Not worth paying for Pro. Sorry!",

Now that you have upgraded, you quickly find out two things: If you want to use the AI features, you need to still pay for them, and there is another level that provides more features. The app is good, maybe great, but I hate the upgrades. They failed to disclose the features of each level, and additional costs. I remember when we called this bait and switch.",

    "AIReview": "<h2>Fotor - AI Photo Editor Review</h2>\n<h3>Overview</h3>\n<p>Fotor – AI Photo Editor has amassed over 38.6 million installs and holds an impressive average rating of 4.219, demonstrating a significant level of user satisfaction within the photography editing app landscape.  Positioned as an “all-in-one AI Ghibli photo editor,” Fotor targets a broad audience – from casual users to artists and photography enthusiasts – with its promise of effortless creativity fueled by artificial intelligence. The app’s core functionality centers around enhancing photos, removing objects, and applying stylistic filters, leveraging features like the AI Photo Enhancer, object removal, and, notably, a &quot;Toy Action Figure AI Generator&quot; alongside trend-focused “GPT Trend” effects. This blend of traditional photo editing tools with emerging AI capabilities aims to provide a comprehensive solution for users looking to revitalize their images or explore new creative avenues.</p>\n<h3>Key Features</h3>\n<p>Fotor’s feature set is deliberately layered, offering both granular control and quick, automated solutions.  Here&#39;s a breakdown of the core functionalities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>AI Photo Enhancer:</strong> This tool is arguably Fotor’s headline feature. It utilizes AI to automatically improve image quality by addressing common issues like blurriness, graininess, and low resolution. The claim of “instantly clarifying blurry photos” is significant for users with older or poorly-shot images.</li>\n<li><strong>Object Removal:</strong>  Fotor employs intelligent background removal technology allowing users to seamlessly eliminate unwanted elements – people, objects, or distractions – from their photos and videos. </li>\n<li><strong>Ghibli Style Filters &amp; Effects:</strong> As the app&#39;s name suggests, Fotor heavily leans into the aesthetic of Studio Ghibli’s animation style. Users can apply filters and effects that mimic the distinctive look and feel of Ghibli films.</li>\n<li><strong>Toy Action Figure AI Generator:</strong> This is a more novel feature – users input a photo and the AI generates a stylized version mimicking a classic toy action figure, offering a unique creative outlet.</li>\n<li><strong>GPT Trend Effects:</strong>  Fotor integrates with GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) technology to create dynamic effects based on current trends. This allows users to experiment with cutting-edge visual styles.</li>\n<li><strong>Basic Photo Editing Tools:</strong> Alongside the AI features, Fotor retains standard photo editing tools including brightness, contrast, saturation, sharpness adjustments, cropping, and red-eye removal.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Strengths</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ease of Use:</strong> The app’s interface is generally intuitive and user-friendly.  The AI Photo Enhancer, in particular, requires minimal input from the user – it largely operates automatically.</li>\n<li><strong>Powerful AI Capabilities:</strong> The core strength lies in its AI-powered image enhancement. The results are frequently impressive, particularly for rescuing low-quality images. The object removal tool is also remarkably effective at removing distractions without introducing significant artifacts.</li>\n<li><strong>Diverse Creative Options:</strong>  The combination of Ghibli filters, the Toy Action Figure Generator, and GPT Trend effects provides a wide range of creative styles to experiment with beyond traditional photo editing. </li>\n<li><strong>Large User Base &amp; Active Development:</strong> The high install count (38.677 million) indicates strong popularity, and combined with a rating of 4.219, suggests ongoing development and community support.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Areas for Improvement</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>AI Over-Reliance:</strong> While the AI Photo Enhancer is powerful, over-reliance on it can sometimes lead to unnatural or overly processed results. Users should be encouraged to experiment with manual adjustments to fine-tune the output.</li>\n<li><strong>Limited Control in Certain Features:</strong>  Some features, like the Ghibli filters, offer limited control over intensity and parameters. Increased customization options would allow users to tailor these effects more precisely.</li>\n<li><strong>Subscription Model Nuances:</strong> While the app is free to download and use, many of the most advanced AI-powered tools are locked behind a subscription (Fotor Premium). The pricing structure could be more transparent. </li>\n<li><strong>Tutorials and Guidance:</strong>  While the interface is generally intuitive, more comprehensive tutorials or guided workflows would benefit novice users who may not immediately grasp all the app&#39;s capabilities.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>User Experience</h3>\n<p>The user experience within Fotor is predominantly positive. Navigation is straightforward, with a clear layout that separates different editing categories. The app’s performance is generally smooth and responsive, although processing complex AI enhancements can occasionally be slow, particularly on older devices.  The drag-and-drop interface for applying filters and adjustments contributes to the app&#39;s ease of use. The transition between photo editing features feels fluid and natural, allowing users to seamlessly switch between tasks. However, the frequent prompts encouraging users to upgrade to Fotor Premium can occasionally disrupt the creative flow.</p>\n<h3>Value for Money</h3>\n<p>As a free app, Fotor offers considerable value, particularly in terms of its AI Photo Enhancer and basic object removal. The Ghibli filters and Toy Action Figure Generator provide entertaining and unique creative options. However, to unlock the full potential of the app—specifically utilizing the advanced AI features consistently and accessing premium effects—a subscription to Fotor Premium is highly recommended. The pricing tiers for the premium subscription could be more clearly defined and perhaps offer a trial period allowing users to assess its value before committing to a paid plan.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Fotor – AI Photo Editor presents itself as a compelling option for anyone seeking a user-friendly photo editing app with powerful AI capabilities. Its impressive install numbers and high rating validate its appeal, and the combination of traditional editing tools and innovative features like the Ghibli style filters and the Toy Action Figure Generator makes it stand out from the competition. While areas for improvement exist – particularly regarding control over AI effects and a more transparent subscription model – Fotor remains a valuable tool for both casual users looking to quickly enhance their photos and creative individuals seeking unique stylistic options.  It’s a strong contender in the crowded photo editing app market, especially for those interested in exploring the possibilities of AI-powered image manipulation.</p>"
