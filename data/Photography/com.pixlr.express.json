Just the usual X but when you hit that, as you probably guessed, it erases all that you just did. It's like that for other features as well, not just the texting. How they missed this is just beyond me. Maybe it's an issue that only i am having. However, idk why that would be. I have a top of the line, $1200 flagship phone and it usually doesn't make mistakes like this. However, im surprised that no one else complained about that yet. Or maybe they have, idk yet. And YES, I have absolutely looked for a \"Done\" button for about 10 minutes, to no avail. So something neeeeeeeds to be done about this. But for now I'm uninstalling and going elsewhere. Somewhere much better actually, but i wont say it on here so i dont wreck their business.",

It shouldn't take more than 1 minute to find how to resize and image. Dont care what other amazing thing it can do, if it cant do the most simple of tasks than it is a failure. I will totally give this a 5 star if they add that in and make it easily accessible. The app is overall great, or it should be if it was an actually good picture editor and not just things to make cool selfies. Ugh...what photo editor cant resize an image, this is so stupid.",

    "AIReview": "<h2>Pixlr AI Photo Editor Review â€“ A Powerful Free Tool With Room to Grow</h2>\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>Pixlr AI Photo Editor, formerly Pixlr Express, has rapidly become a dominant force in the mobile photo editing landscape. Boasting over 100 million installs and a robust 4.35-star rating from more than 1.2 million users, this free application offers an impressive suite of features leveraging both traditional image editing techniques and increasingly sophisticated AI capabilities.  The appâ€™s core mission â€“ to empower creativity through accessible photo manipulation â€“ is successfully achieved, particularly for those new to advanced photo editing. The recent rebranding to &quot;AI Art Photo Editor&quot; signals a significant shift in the platform&#39;s focus, integrating generative AI tools alongside its established functionality. This review will delve into Pixlr AIâ€™s strengths and weaknesses, evaluating its suitability for both casual users and more experienced photographers.</p>\n<h2>Key Features</h2>\n<p>The appâ€™s feature set is extensive, categorized primarily around image retouching, creative effects, and â€“ crucially â€“ AI-powered generation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>AI Art Generator:</strong> This is the headline feature. Users can input text prompts to generate entirely new images from scratch, exploring styles ranging from photorealistic landscapes to abstract art. The quality varies depending on the prompt&#39;s specificity; however, itâ€™s remarkably effective for producing surprising and visually appealing results.</li>\n<li><strong>AI Photo Enhancer:</strong> Leveraging AI, this tool automatically improves photos with features like auto-enhance, background removal, object removal, and portrait retouching.  It operates surprisingly well, often delivering noticeable improvements in a single tap.</li>\n<li><strong>Traditional Editing Tools:</strong> Pixlr retains its roots as a robust photo editor offering a comprehensive collection of tools: layers, masking, curves, color adjustments (brightness, contrast, saturation), blur, sharpen, vignettes, and more. These are seamlessly integrated with the AI features.</li>\n<li><strong>Collage Maker:</strong>  The app includes a dedicated collage maker allowing users to combine multiple images into various layouts, complete with customizable borders and effects. Over 2 million combinations of free effects further expands design possibilities.</li>\n<li><strong>Templates &amp; Presets:</strong> A vast library of pre-designed templates and presets provides instant style transformations for photos, catering to different aesthetics and social media platforms.</li>\n<li><strong>One-Tap Effects:</strong> Simple, impactful filters and effects are readily available for quick enhancements.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Strengths</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Powerful AI Integration:</strong> The AI Art Generator and Photo Enhancer represent a significant leap forward in mobile photo editing. They provide genuinely useful tools that can dramatically reduce the time needed to achieve professional-looking results.</li>\n<li><strong>Intuitive Interface (for Beginners):</strong> Despite the breadth of features, Pixlr maintains an intuitive user interface, making it accessible to beginners who are unfamiliar with complex image editing terminology. The guided tutorials and tooltips further contribute to this ease of use.</li>\n<li><strong>High Level of Customization:</strong> For users comfortable with traditional photo editing techniques, Pixlr offers a remarkable degree of control over every aspect of the image. Layer masking and advanced adjustment tools provide flexibility that rivals desktop software.</li>\n<li><strong>Large Community &amp; Support:</strong> With 100 million+ installs, Pixlr benefits from a large user base providing ample resources for troubleshooting and inspiration via online forums and tutorials.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Areas for Improvement</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>AI Output Consistency:</strong> While impressive, the AI Art Generatorâ€™s output can be inconsistent. Complex prompts still require careful refinement to achieve desired results. A more granular control over stylistic parameters within the AI generator would be beneficial.</li>\n<li><strong>Limited Free Tier Restrictions (Increasing):</strong>  While &quot;free,&quot; certain advanced AI features and higher resolutions for generated images are locked behind a subscription, which could feel restrictive to casual users who primarily want to experiment with the AI tools. The app is increasingly pushing premium subscriptions.</li>\n<li><strong>Performance on Lower-End Devices:</strong> Some users have reported performance issues â€“ particularly lag when using multiple AI features or working with large image files â€“ on older smartphones and tablets. Optimization for lower-end devices would improve accessibility.</li>\n<li><strong>Tutorial Depth for Advanced Features:</strong> While beginner tutorials are plentiful, more in-depth guides covering the advanced layer masking, curve adjustments, and other complex tools would be welcome.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>User Experience</h2>\n<p>The user experience is generally very positive. The appâ€™s navigation is clear and logical, with a well-organized layout that makes it easy to find the desired features. The transition between traditional editing and AI tools is seamless.  However, the sheer volume of options can feel overwhelming at first. A more streamlined onboarding process could help new users quickly grasp the core functionalities. The responsiveness of the app is generally good, though as noted previously, performance degrades noticeably on less powerful devices.</p>\n<h2>Value for Money</h2>\n<p>Pixlr AI Photo Editor offers exceptional value for money, being entirely free to download and use. While premium features are available through a subscription, the core functionality â€“ including the AI Art Generator and Photo Enhancer â€“ provides immense creative potential without requiring any financial commitment. The subscription model is priced competitively compared to similar apps, offering access to higher resolution generation, more advanced AI controls, and removal of watermarks.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Pixlr AI Photo Editor represents a significant advancement in mobile photo editing. Its powerful AI tools, combined with its robust traditional editing capabilities and intuitive user interface, make it an outstanding choice for both beginners and experienced photographers. Despite some minor areas for improvement â€“ particularly regarding output consistency and device optimization â€“ the appâ€™s strengths far outweigh its weaknesses. The free version provides a remarkable level of functionality, making it a highly recommended download for anyone looking to explore their creativity with AI-powered photo editing.  The continued development of the AI features suggests a bright future for Pixlr as a leading platform in this rapidly evolving space.</p>"
