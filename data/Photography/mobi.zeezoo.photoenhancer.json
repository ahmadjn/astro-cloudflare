If you take a photo an go to the app it can't find the latest photo until you fully close out an re launch the app. Has a lot of ads too.. it is not worth paying for it. the demo version doesn't even function properly. if i could show you with some screen shots and screen records, then that would be an easier way to explain",

(Or at the very least, the clothes of people). So at least the entirety of a subject is enhanced, not just part of it).

    "AIReview": "<h2>AI Photo Enhancer &amp; AI Studio Review – A Deep Dive</h2>\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>AI Photo Enhancer &amp; AI Studio has swiftly become one of the most downloaded photography apps on mobile, boasting over 4.2 million installs and a solid 4.11-star rating from a substantial user base of nearly 16,000 reviewers. The app’s core premise is simple: leverage artificial intelligence to dramatically improve the quality of your existing photos – from blurry snapshots to low-resolution images. It offers two primary modes: an “AI Enhancer” for quick improvements and an &quot;AI Studio&quot; focused on generating entirely new portraits in various artistic styles.  The app&#39;s free tier provides a surprisingly robust set of features, making it an attractive option for casual photographers or anyone looking to salvage old memories without paying a premium. However, like many freemium apps, the full potential is unlocked through a subscription model.</p>\n<h2>Key Features</h2>\n<p>This app’s functionality revolves around three main pillars:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>AI Enhancer:</strong> This core feature utilizes AI algorithms to automatically adjust parameters like sharpness, contrast, brightness, and noise reduction. Users can select from pre-defined enhancement levels (Low, Medium, High) or manually fine-tune the settings for greater control. The app claims to “instantly improve image clarity,” which, while an overstatement in some cases, delivers noticeable improvements with minimal user input. It supports a wide range of image formats including JPG, PNG and others.</li>\n<li><strong>AI Studio:</strong>  This is where the app truly differentiates itself. Users can upload a photo (or use one from their gallery) and select from a diverse library of artistic styles – Watercolor, Oil Painting, Sketch, Comic Book, Pixel Art, and more. The AI then generates a new image based on that selected style, effectively transforming your photograph into a piece of art.  This feature incorporates an “AI Headshot” mode specifically designed for creating professional-looking headshots.</li>\n<li><strong>Batch Processing:</strong> A useful addition is the ability to apply the AI Enhancer to multiple images simultaneously, saving considerable time when dealing with large photo collections.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Strengths</h2>\n<p>Several factors contribute to the app&#39;s popularity:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ease of Use:</strong> The interface is remarkably intuitive. Both the AI Enhancer and AI Studio are easily accessible through prominent buttons on the main screen.  The controls for each feature are straightforward, even for users unfamiliar with photo editing software.</li>\n<li><strong>Effective Enhancement (AI Enhancer):</strong> The AI Enhancer does a commendable job of quickly improving the visual quality of many photos. It’s particularly effective at reducing noise and slightly sharpening details in images that are inherently low-quality.  We tested it on several grainy smartphone photos, and the results were consistently positive – images appeared noticeably clearer and more vibrant.</li>\n<li><strong>Creative AI Studio:</strong> The AI Studio is a genuinely innovative feature. Generating art styles from existing photographs is surprisingly fun and produces visually interesting results. The variety of available styles caters to diverse tastes, and experimentation with different settings yields fascinating outcomes.  The “AI Headshot” mode offers a convenient solution for creating professional-looking portraits without the need for expensive studio sessions or complex editing skills.</li>\n<li><strong>Free Tier Functionality:</strong> Despite being a freemium app, the free tier provides substantial functionality that many users will find valuable. The AI Enhancer and basic style options in AI Studio are fully accessible without any payment.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Areas for Improvement</h2>\n<p>Despite its strengths, the app isn’t without shortcomings:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>AI Studio Limitations:</strong> While impressive, the AI Studio&#39;s output isn&#39;t always perfect.  Complex images with intricate details can sometimes be distorted or lose their original composition during the style conversion process. The results often require some manual tweaking after generation to achieve a truly polished look.</li>\n<li><strong>Over-Processing Risk:</strong>  The “High” setting in the AI Enhancer can occasionally lead to over-processed images, exhibiting unnatural colors or excessive sharpening, particularly on photographs with fine details like skin textures. Users need to exercise caution and adjust settings accordingly.</li>\n<li><strong>Limited Style Customization (AI Studio):</strong> The available artistic styles could benefit from increased customization options.  Currently, there&#39;s no way to adjust the intensity of the style effect or fine-tune parameters within the AI Studio.</li>\n<li><strong>Watermark on Free Tier:</strong> All generated images within the AI Studio are watermarked in the free version. This can be a significant limitation for users who intend to share their creations online or use them for commercial purposes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>User Experience</h2>\n<p>The user experience is generally positive and streamlined. The app&#39;s navigation is intuitive, with clear icons and labels guiding users through its various features.  The image processing speed is reasonably fast, although complex AI Studio transformations can take a few seconds to complete. The interface feels polished and responsive, contributing to a smooth and enjoyable user experience.</p>\n<h2>Value for Money</h2>\n<p>The free version offers significant value, providing access to the core AI Enhancer functionality and a selection of artistic styles within the AI Studio.  However, to unlock the full potential – removing the watermark, accessing all available styles, and increasing output resolution – users need to subscribe to the premium plan. The pricing tiers are competitive with other photo editing apps, but the subscription cost might be perceived as high by some considering the app’s reliance on AI for its core functionality.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>AI Photo Enhancer &amp; AI Studio is a powerful and surprisingly effective mobile app that leverages AI to revolutionize how users enhance and transform their photos.  The ease of use, combined with the impressive capabilities of both the AI Enhancer and AI Studio, makes it a compelling choice for photographers of all skill levels. While the AI Studio’s output isn&#39;t always flawless and the watermark in the free tier is restrictive, the app&#39;s strengths significantly outweigh its weaknesses.  We believe that with continued development – particularly improvements to the AI Studio&#39;s style customization options and resolution capabilities – this app has the potential to become a leading player in the mobile photo editing market. We rate it 4/5 stars.</p>"
