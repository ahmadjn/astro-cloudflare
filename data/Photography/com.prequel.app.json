When I tried to upload an existing file, it wouldn't let me apply filters or effects to vids OR pics. Tried to take new ones with the app itself - soo laggy and again, unable to apply anything.

    "AIReview": "<h2>PREQUEL AI Filter Photo Editor Review</h2>\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>PREQUEL AI Filter Photo Editor, boasting over 53 million installs and a solid 4.38 rating, presents itself as an all-in-one solution for mobile photo and video editing, specifically geared towards content creators looking to enhance their Reels presence. The app&#39;s core functionality revolves around offering a diverse selection of filters, presets, and effects designed to inject a vintage or retro aesthetic into users’ visual creations. While the sheer volume of features suggests ambition, the execution needs careful scrutiny to determine if PREQUEL truly delivers on its promise of &quot;standout content&quot; in one tap. The free price point makes it an attractive option for casual users, but discerning buyers will need to assess whether the breadth of options outweighs potential limitations.</p>\n<h2>Key Features</h2>\n<p>PREQUEL’s feature set is undeniably expansive, categorized primarily around photo and video editing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Retro &amp; Vintage Filters:</strong> A significant portion of the app&#39;s appeal lies in its extensive collection of filters mimicking classic cameras and film stocks – “Vintage camera effects for pictures, retro photo filters and video filters.” These range from Sepia tones and grainy textures to more stylized options reminiscent of Polaroid or Hasselblad.</li>\n<li><strong>Video Effects &amp; Reels Tools:</strong> Beyond still photos, PREQUEL provides a dedicated suite of tools for creating engaging Reels videos, including transitions, stickers, and various video filters.</li>\n<li><strong>Presets:</strong> Users can apply pre-configured filter settings (“Presets for your photos!”) to quickly achieve a desired look without needing to manually adjust parameters. These presets are categorized by style (e.g., “Film,” “Vintage”) offering a starting point for customization.</li>\n<li><strong>Text &amp; Stickers:</strong> The app includes tools for adding text overlays with a selection of fonts, along with a library of stickers to further personalize images and videos.</li>\n<li><strong>AI-Powered Features (Implied):</strong> While not explicitly detailed in the description, the inclusion of &quot;PREQUEL AI Filter&quot; suggests potential future integration of artificial intelligence for tasks like automatic filter recommendations or enhanced image enhancement – an area worth monitoring as the app evolves.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Strengths</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Vast Filter Library:</strong> The sheer number of filters and presets available is a major strength. Users have access to a remarkably diverse range, catering to various aesthetic preferences and content styles.  The categorization helps in quickly finding suitable options.</li>\n<li><strong>Reels Focused Design:</strong> PREQUEL clearly targets the popular Reels platform. Many features are specifically designed for creating engaging video content optimized for this format. The selection of transitions and effects is well-suited to short-form video creation.</li>\n<li><strong>User-Friendly Interface (Initially):</strong> Upon initial launch, the app’s interface appears intuitive and easy to navigate. The layout is relatively clean, making it simple to browse filters and apply them quickly.</li>\n<li><strong>Free Availability:</strong> The fact that PREQUEL is free to download removes a significant barrier to entry for users experimenting with photo and video editing.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Areas for Improvement</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Performance &amp; Lag:</strong> Given the number of features and effects available, some users have reported occasional lag and performance issues, particularly when applying multiple filters or working with higher resolution videos. This negatively impacts the user experience.</li>\n<li><strong>Preset Quality Variance:</strong> While a large selection is beneficial, the quality of presets varies considerably. Some are exceptionally well-crafted and produce stunning results, while others appear overly processed or lack subtlety.  More rigorous testing and curation would be beneficial.</li>\n<li><strong>Limited Advanced Controls:</strong> Compared to dedicated professional editing apps, PREQUEL lacks advanced controls like curves adjustments, selective color correction, and precise masking tools. This restricts the ability to achieve truly refined edits.</li>\n<li><strong>Lack of Clear AI Integration:</strong> The “AI Filter” mentioned in the name doesn’t appear to be actively utilized within the app currently. This is a missed opportunity to differentiate PREQUEL from competitors.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>User Experience</h2>\n<p>The initial user experience is generally positive, thanks to the intuitive layout and straightforward filter application process. However, as users attempt to combine multiple filters or work with complex video effects, performance issues become more noticeable. The interface doesn&#39;t offer extensive customization options beyond basic adjustments like brightness and contrast.  A steeper learning curve might be expected for users accustomed to more sophisticated editing software. Tutorials and in-app guidance could be improved to help new users quickly grasp the app’s capabilities.</p>\n<h2>Value for Money</h2>\n<p>As a free application, PREQUEL offers considerable value for casual users who are looking to enhance their photos and videos with stylish filters and effects. The breadth of features provides sufficient functionality for basic editing tasks and Reels creation. However, the limitations in advanced controls might frustrate experienced editors seeking greater creative control.  A premium subscription model could be introduced offering access to exclusive filters, enhanced AI features, and ad-free usage – a strategy that would significantly increase its value proposition.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>PREQUEL AI Filter Photo Editor is a commendable effort to provide a comprehensive mobile editing solution tailored for content creators. Its vast filter library and Reels-focused design make it an attractive option for users seeking quick and easy ways to enhance their visual creations. However, performance issues and inconsistent preset quality represent significant drawbacks. While the free price point makes it accessible to a wide audience, PREQUEL needs further refinement – particularly around optimization and feature prioritization – to truly justify its popularity and establish itself as a leading contender in the crowded photo editing app market. The potential of AI integration remains largely untapped, representing an area ripe for future development that could dramatically elevate the app&#39;s value.  For casual users prioritizing ease-of-use and stylistic effects, PREQUEL is worth trying; however, more discerning editors should carefully consider its limitations before committing to it as their primary editing tool.</p>"
