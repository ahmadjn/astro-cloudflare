The layering function puts each layer in the same row, so it's hard to edit the layers under another. I also hope that they make it so that you can add more than one piece of text.

    "AIReview": "<h2>Videoleap: AI Video Editor – A Comprehensive Review</h2>\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>Videoleap, currently boasting 18,871,333 installs and a robust 4.43328/5 rating based on 195,513 user reviews, positions itself as the ultimate all-in-one AI video editor, reel maker, and video enhancer.  The app’s core promise – transforming ideas into professional-looking videos quickly and easily – is a compelling one, particularly in today&#39;s saturated social media landscape. The “Free” price point makes it an attractive entry point for both casual users and budding content creators looking to experiment with AI-powered video editing without significant financial commitment.  However, the success of Videoleap hinges on the efficacy of its AI tools and the overall usability of its interface. This review delves into a detailed analysis of the app’s features, performance, and user experience to determine whether it lives up to its ambitious claims.</p>\n<h2>Key Features</h2>\n<p>Videoleap offers a broad suite of features designed to streamline the video creation process. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>AI Video Generator:</strong> The cornerstone of the application, this feature allows users to generate videos from text prompts or image inputs. It leverages AI to create dynamic scenes and add appropriate music and effects.</li>\n<li><strong>Reel Maker:</strong> Specifically tailored for Instagram Reels, this tool provides pre-designed templates, trending audio tracks, and easy editing capabilities.</li>\n<li><strong>Video Enhancer (AI Upscaling):</strong> A standout feature that uses AI to improve the resolution and quality of existing videos – a critical benefit for repurposing older content or low-quality footage.</li>\n<li><strong>Smart Cut:</strong> Automatically segments video clips based on changes in audio or visual cues, saving users significant editing time.</li>\n<li><strong>Text-to-Speech:</strong> Converts text into natural-sounding voiceovers, adding another layer of creative control.</li>\n<li><strong>Music Library &amp; Sound Effects:</strong>  Provides a library of royalty-free music and sound effects to enhance videos.</li>\n<li><strong>Transitions &amp; Effects:</strong> Offers a variety of transitions and visual effects for adding polish to your creations.</li>\n<li><strong>Green Screen Effect:</strong> Allows users to remove backgrounds seamlessly, opening up possibilities for dynamic content creation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Strengths</h2>\n<p>Several aspects of Videoleap contribute to its popularity:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ease of Use (Beginner-Friendly):</strong> The app’s intuitive interface and guided workflows make it remarkably accessible even for users with no prior video editing experience.  The Smart Cut feature is a prime example, drastically reducing the time required to create engaging clips.</li>\n<li><strong>Powerful AI Capabilities:</strong> The AI Video Generator and Video Enhancer demonstrate genuine potential. While not always perfect, they significantly accelerate the creative process and provide impressive results – especially considering the app’s free tier.  The ability to upscale low-resolution videos to a usable standard is particularly valuable.</li>\n<li><strong>Relevance to Current Trends:</strong> The dedicated Reel Maker aligns perfectly with the dominant platform for short-form video content. Offering pre-designed templates incorporating trending audio ensures users can quickly create relevant and engaging Reels.</li>\n<li><strong>Large User Base &amp; Active Community:</strong> With over 18 million installs, Videoleap enjoys a substantial user base, fostering a potential community for support, inspiration, and sharing creations.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Areas for Improvement</h2>\n<p>Despite its strengths, Videoleap isn&#39;t without limitations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>AI Limitations:</strong> The AI-generated content, while impressive at times, can occasionally produce unnatural or slightly jarring results.  More refined control over the AI’s parameters would greatly improve consistency and creative output.</li>\n<li><strong>Watermark on Free Tier:</strong> A prominent watermark is applied to videos created using the free version, which may be undesirable for professional use cases. Removing this requires a subscription upgrade.</li>\n<li><strong>Limited Advanced Editing Options:</strong> Compared to dedicated professional video editing software (e.g., Adobe Premiere Pro), Videoleap lacks advanced features like multi-track editing or complex color grading tools.</li>\n<li><strong>Performance on Lower-End Devices:</strong>  Given the processing demands of AI-powered features, the app’s performance can be noticeably sluggish on older smartphones or devices with limited RAM.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>User Experience</h2>\n<p>The user experience is generally positive and intuitive. The onboarding process is seamless, guiding users through the core functionalities without overwhelming them. Navigation within the app is straightforward, with clearly labeled icons and a logical layout.  However, the abundance of features can sometimes feel slightly cluttered, potentially leading to confusion for new users. A more streamlined interface focusing on the most frequently used tools could enhance usability. The drag-and-drop functionality for adding elements feels natural and responsive.</p>\n<h2>Value for Money</h2>\n<p>Videoleap operates with a freemium model. The free version offers access to core features like the Reel Maker, basic video editing tools, and limited AI capabilities – accompanied by the aforementioned watermark.  The paid subscription unlocks premium features such as removing the watermark, accessing advanced AI functionalities (including higher-resolution upscaling), and utilizing additional templates and effects.  Pricing tiers are competitive with other mobile video editors, but the effectiveness of the paid features will ultimately determine whether the upgrade is worthwhile for individual users. A trial period would be beneficial to assess the full potential before committing to a subscription.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Videoleap represents a significant step forward in accessible AI-powered video editing. Its intuitive interface, powerful AI tools (particularly the Video Enhancer and Smart Cut), and focus on trending content formats make it a compelling option for anyone looking to create engaging videos quickly and easily. While limitations exist – primarily regarding the consistency of the AI and the presence of a watermark in the free version – these are outweighed by the app&#39;s overall value proposition.  For casual users, hobbyists, and aspiring social media creators, Videoleap is undoubtedly worth exploring. However, those seeking professional-grade editing capabilities may find themselves wanting more advanced features available only through a paid subscription. The current rating of 4.43 indicates widespread satisfaction, suggesting that Videoleap is successfully meeting the needs of its target audience – at least for now.</p>"
