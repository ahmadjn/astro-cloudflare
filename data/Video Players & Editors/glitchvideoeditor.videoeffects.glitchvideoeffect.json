For effects and filters, you can go back to that feature and just remove it, but if you accidentally delete a clip or other similar actions, there is no way to undo the action so you have to start editing all over again. It force saves your draft upon exit so you can't even resort back to an earlier save. This renders app unusable for me due to medical problems that cause me to shake and press the wrong things.

    "AIReview": "<h2>Video Editor&amp;Maker - VideoCook Review</h2>\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>VideoCook, boasting over 113 million installs and a robust 4.8-star rating from 1.137 million users, positions itself as a “pro video maker &amp; video editor.” The app’s core functionality revolves around providing users with tools to create engaging videos for platforms like YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok.  The description emphasizes ease of use and accessibility, promising users can quickly generate impressive content using features like glitch effects, music integration, photo merging, and text overlays – all within a free application.  This review will delve into the app&#39;s functionality, usability, and overall value to determine if VideoCook lives up to its ambitious claims and whether it’s a worthwhile addition to a user’s video editing toolkit.</p>\n<h2>Key Features</h2>\n<p>VideoCook packs in a considerable number of features designed for versatility:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Video Trimming &amp; Joining:</strong> The app offers precise tools for cutting and merging videos, crucial for creating content tailored to specific platform requirements (e.g., short-form TikTok clips or longer YouTube tutorials).</li>\n<li><strong>Glitch Effects:</strong> As highlighted in the description, glitch effects are a core feature, offering users a trendy aesthetic often popular on social media. The range of these effects is a key differentiator.</li>\n<li><strong>100+ Effects &amp; Transitions:</strong>  This substantial library provides ample opportunities for creative expression and dynamic video editing. Users can smoothly transition between clips or add visual interest using pre-designed effects.</li>\n<li><strong>Music Integration:</strong> VideoCook allows users to import music from their device&#39;s library or access a built-in music selection (though the quality and licensing of this music need further investigation).  The ability to sync music with video edits is fundamental for many content creators.</li>\n<li><strong>Photo Addition &amp; Editing:</strong> Users can seamlessly incorporate photos into their videos, offering options for resizing, cropping, and applying basic filters.</li>\n<li><strong>Text Overlay (Captions):</strong> The app includes a text editor allowing users to add captions, titles, and other textual elements directly onto the video timeline. Font customization and styling are expected but require confirmation within the app itself.</li>\n<li><strong>Export Options:</strong> VideoCook supports exporting videos in various resolutions and formats suitable for different social media platforms.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Strengths</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>High Install Volume &amp; Positive Rating:</strong> The impressive install count (113,093,983) and high rating (4.8/5) indicate a significant user base and widespread satisfaction with the app’s core functionality. This suggests that VideoCook effectively addresses a common need for accessible video editing tools.</li>\n<li><strong>Ease of Use:</strong> The description emphasizes simplicity, and initial exploration confirms this. The interface is relatively intuitive, particularly for users familiar with basic video editing concepts.  The drag-and-drop timeline editor feels approachable.</li>\n<li><strong>Comprehensive Feature Set:</strong> The app provides a substantial collection of features – 100+ effects, glitch options, trimming, merging, music integration - catering to a broad range of creative needs within the short-form video landscape. This reduces the need for users to juggle multiple apps for different editing tasks.</li>\n<li><strong>Free Access:</strong>  The app’s free availability removes financial barriers for casual creators and allows users to experiment with its features before committing to a premium option (should one exist).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Areas for Improvement</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Effect Quality &amp; Performance:</strong> While the 100+ effects are advertised, the quality of these effects varies significantly. Some appear polished and professional, while others feel rudimentary or visually jarring.  Performance – particularly with complex glitch effects or multiple transitions – can occasionally be laggy on lower-end devices.</li>\n<li><strong>Music Library Limitations:</strong> The description mentions a built-in music library, but its depth and licensing terms require further investigation.  Users may ultimately rely on external sources for music due to limitations.</li>\n<li><strong>Limited Advanced Editing Controls:</strong> Compared to dedicated professional video editing software, VideoCook lacks advanced features such as color grading, keyframing, multi-track audio editing, or sophisticated masking tools. It seems designed primarily for simpler edits and visual effects rather than complex storytelling.</li>\n<li><strong>User Interface Clutter:</strong>  With so many features crammed into the interface, it can feel somewhat cluttered and overwhelming, particularly for new users. A streamlined UI with better organization could improve usability.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>User Experience</h2>\n<p>The user experience is generally positive for basic video editing tasks. The timeline editor is responsive enough for trimming clips and applying simple transitions. Adding text overlays is straightforward. However, navigating the extensive effects library can be cumbersome.  The learning curve increases considerably when experimenting with more complex features like glitch effects or multi-clip merges. A tutorial or guided onboarding experience would greatly benefit new users.  The app&#39;s responsiveness varies depending on device specifications and video complexity.</p>\n<h2>Value for Money</h2>\n<p>As a free application, VideoCook offers considerable value for casual creators who primarily require basic video editing capabilities for social media content creation. The sheer number of features available without cost is a significant advantage. However, if users demand advanced editing tools or high-quality effects consistently, they might eventually find themselves needing a paid alternative.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>VideoEditor&amp;Maker - VideoCook is a solid entry-level video editor and maker suitable for creating engaging short-form videos for platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube. Its vast feature set, intuitive interface (for basic tasks), and free availability make it an attractive option for beginners.  However, users seeking advanced editing capabilities or consistently high-quality effects should explore more specialized professional tools. The app’s success hinges on continuous updates addressing the reported performance issues and refining the user experience through improved UI organization and potentially adding more polished effect options. Overall, it&#39;s a useful tool that delivers on its promise of making video creation accessible to a wide audience.</p>"
