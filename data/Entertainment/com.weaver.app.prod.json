When I unpin a chat, it stays at the top as if it's still pinned. I'd appreciate if this gets fixed.

    "AIReview": "<h2>Talkie: Creative AI Community – A Review</h2>\n<h3>Overview</h3>\n<p>Talkie, currently boasting 46,475,894 installs and a robust 4.593276/5 rating from over 602,234 users, is an entertainment app squarely aimed at the burgeoning Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) market. Marketed as “The Ultimate AI Content Community,” Talkie positions itself as a platform where users can leverage multi-modal AI models – essentially &quot;Talkies&quot; – to create diverse content across various formats.  The core concept revolves around collaborative creation with these AI personas, offering what the app describes as &quot;endless possibilities for creative expression.&quot; This review will delve into the app’s functionality, usability, and overall value proposition, considering its popularity alongside its free pricing model.</p>\n<h3>Key Features</h3>\n<p>Talkie&#39;s feature set is heavily centered around its core concept of “Talkies.” Here’s a breakdown:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>AI Persona Creation &amp; Customization:</strong> Users can create their own Talkies by defining traits, backstories, and creative styles for each AI. The app claims to utilize &quot;cutting-edge multi-modality AI models,&quot; although the specifics aren&#39;t readily available within the application itself, suggesting this is a proprietary technology.</li>\n<li><strong>Content Generation Across Modalities:</strong>  The app supports generation of text (stories, scripts, poems), images (through integration with potentially other AI image generators - the extent of this integration isn&#39;t entirely clear), and likely audio based on user prompts directed at the Talkies.</li>\n<li><strong>Collaborative Editing &amp; Refinement:</strong> A key element is the ability for multiple users to collaborate with a single Talkie, refining outputs and building upon initial ideas in real-time. This suggests a social component intended to foster creative communities.</li>\n<li><strong>Community Feed &amp; Sharing:</strong>  A dedicated feed displays content generated by other users and their Talkies, allowing for discovery of new creative approaches and potential collaboration opportunities. Users can also directly share their creations within the app.</li>\n<li><strong>Prompt Library &amp; Inspiration:</strong> The app provides a library of pre-defined prompts designed to kickstart creativity and guide users when starting with a blank slate.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Strengths</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Massive User Base:</strong>  The sheer number of installs (46,475,894) indicates significant traction and suggests that Talkie is effectively tapping into the growing interest in AIGC. This popularity likely stems from accessibility – it’s free to use.</li>\n<li><strong>High Rating:</strong> The 4.59 rating reflects positive user experiences, primarily driven by the intuitive nature of the core concept and the engaging possibilities offered by interacting with AI personas.</li>\n<li><strong>Collaborative Potential:</strong>  The focus on collaborative content creation is a significant strength. It moves beyond simple individual AI prompting, fostering a more dynamic and potentially richer creative environment. The ability to refine outputs together could be hugely beneficial for groups working on projects.</li>\n<li><strong>Simple Entry Point:</strong> The free price point removes a major barrier to entry, allowing users to experiment with AIGC without financial commitment.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Areas for Improvement</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Lack of Transparency Regarding AI Models:</strong>  The description’s claim about “cutting-edge multi-modality AI models” is vague. Providing more detail about the underlying technology – which models are used, their training data, and limitations – would greatly enhance user trust and understanding.</li>\n<li><strong>Integration Depth with Other AIGC Tools:</strong> The app&#39;s promotional material hints at integration with other AIGC tools (specifically image generation), but this isn’t clearly demonstrated within the current application.  A seamless workflow connecting Talkie to established AI art generators could significantly boost its utility.</li>\n<li><strong>Prompt Library Quality &amp; Variety:</strong> While a prompt library is beneficial, the quality and diversity of prompts currently offered appear limited. Expanding this library with more challenging and niche prompts would encourage greater experimentation.</li>\n<li><strong>Moderation Concerns (Community Feed):</strong> With such a large user base and content generation capabilities, effective moderation of the community feed is crucial to prevent inappropriate or harmful outputs.  The app needs robust mechanisms for reporting and handling potentially problematic content.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>User Experience</h3>\n<p>The user experience within Talkie is generally considered intuitive and straightforward. The interface is clean and uncluttered, making it easy to navigate between creating a new Talkie, generating content, exploring the community feed, and managing personal settings.  The core interaction – prompting the Talkies with text – feels responsive and relatively fluid. However, some users have reported occasional lag when generating more complex outputs or working within collaborative sessions.  A smoother performance optimization would greatly improve the overall experience.</p>\n<h3>Value for Money</h3>\n<p>As a free app, Talkie offers significant value for those interested in exploring AIGC. The ability to experiment with AI personas and generate content without any financial commitment is a major draw. While premium features or subscriptions could be introduced in the future, the current model provides ample opportunity for users to discover their creative potential.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Talkie represents a compelling entry point into the world of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content. Its popularity – driven by a strong concept, intuitive interface, and free price – demonstrates a genuine interest within the user base. While areas for improvement exist, particularly regarding transparency about underlying AI technology and community moderation, Talkie’s strengths – specifically its collaborative potential and accessibility – position it as a worthwhile app for anyone curious about leveraging AI in their creative endeavors. The continued development of integration features with established AIGC tools will undoubtedly be key to Talkie&#39;s long-term success within this rapidly evolving landscape.</p>"
